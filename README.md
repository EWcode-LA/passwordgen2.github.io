# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## Demo

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
